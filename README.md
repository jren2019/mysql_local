This repo is trying to spin up a local database with Docker. This makes it easy to test your code and write data without installing and configuring a lot of tools. It explains how you can customize your Docker database via scripts, create database and tables. While this repo is for MySQL, it’s the same for PostgreSQL!
Follow along and let’s create a custom MySQL which contains your desired tables and data.
